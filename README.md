# Unit_-2-Project
Code Along with Students for Heroku Deployment


My thoughts for this project revolved around daily usability. I knew i culdn't solve world hunger today, so what could I make that was do-able, stretch my design skills and use all uses of CRUD? A blog came to mind.

The app uses all 7 restful routes and a "like" button. As for as UX, I wanted the feeling of open-mindedness and a quite place to unfold one's ideas.

My design plans started early on. Last project, i overwhelmed myself with UX possibilities that I couldn't find a place to start. And because of it, I felt my project suffered. This time, I began with my root idea, the blog, and began to expand on that. What kind of experience did I was the user to have? From there, I chose my graphic art, then my color palette. I took time in researching, in both my personal anecdotes and bonified studies, how users interact with web pages. I learned pages should be centered around 3 basic colors, nav panels are naturally assumed to the right, and title bars should lead back to the homepage. A positive experience can be reduced to the most simple experience. Good UX should be intuitively understood rather than learned.  

My code follows the 7 RESTFUL routes, as well as incorporates a "like" button. When the button is clicked, a like is pushdown down into the db. Each route intuitively interacts with each page for a seamless experience.
